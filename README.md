## About Me ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an Accountant and Tax Analyst with a robust background in data analysis, driven by a keen interest in uncovering insights from data. With over eight years of experience using MS Excel and Power BI for financial and tax data, I recently expanded my expertise by completing the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. This certification has equipped me with skills in Excel, Tableau, SQL, and R programming.

I am excited to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of data analysis and contribute to innovative solutions. Let's connect and explore the limitless possibilities of data together!
