## About Me üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an Accountant and Tax Analyst with a robust background in data analysis with Excel and Power BI, driven by a keen interest in uncovering insights from data. With over eight years of experience using MS Excel for financial and tax data, I recently expanded my expertise by completing the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. This certification has equipped me with skills in Excel, Tableau, SQL, and R programming.

I am fascinated by the potential of data to reveal patterns and inform strategic decisions. My passion lies in using data analytics to optimize processes, identify key trends and insights, and support data-driven decision-making. On this GitHub profile, you'll find projects that reflect my journey and growth in the data analytics field, showcasing my ability to transform data into meaningful insights.

As I transition into a full-time Data Analyst role, I am excited to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of data analysis and contribute to innovative solutions. Let's connect and explore the limitless possibilities of data together!
